# Chess Game Application

Welcome to the **Chess Game Application**! This project is a fully-featured, Java-based chess game that you can play on
your local machine. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, this application offers a fun and challenging
experience.

## Resources
This project was developed following the tutorial series from this YouTube playlist:
[Complete Chess Game in Java](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt&si=suMZsn140Ro9GWzL)

## Features

### Board Setup
- **A standard 8x8 chessboard with alternating colors and proper initial placement of pieces (pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, kings).**
### Piece Movement: Implement the movement rules for each piece:
- **Pawn: Moves forward but captures diagonally. Can move two squares on the first move.**
- **Rook: Moves horizontally or vertically.**
- **Knight: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction, one square in a perpendicular direction).**
- **Bishop: Moves diagonally.**
- **Queen: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.**
- **King: Moves one square in any direction.**
- **Turn-based System: Alternating turns between White and Black players.**
- **Move Validation: Ensure moves are valid based on the rules (no moving through other pieces except for the knight, no moving into check, etc.).**
- **Check/Checkmate Detection: Detect when a king is in check or checkmate.**
- **En Passant: Special pawn capture move when a pawn moves two squares forward.**
- **Pawn Promotion: Allow pawn promotion when reaching the opponentâ€™s back rank (promotion to queen, rook, bishop, or knight).**
- **Castling: Implement castling on both kingside and queenside, ensuring the conditions are met (no pieces between the king and rook, neither piece has moved, etc.).**
